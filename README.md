# Lab4NodeJS

In this lab, two things have to be made:

1. Write a file in node that verifies (given an input text) if the
parentheses, braces and brackets are correctly written, that is, they are
properly open and closed; execute said file using the
"node <file>" command.
2. Generate a basic server, using the node library 'http' and that
get to the path "/ hello /: name", show the user a JSON showing
{"Hello": "<name>"}

And the exercises have to be made in two different branches.
